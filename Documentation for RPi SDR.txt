This is the command line tool used to get the Software Defined Radio to receive the signals produced by the YEASU. 

sudo rtl_fm -f 145.926e6 -M wbfm -s 260k -r 22050 -g 50 -o 1 |aplay -r 22050k -f S16_LE -c 1 -q -V mono -D sysdefault:CARD=ALSA

Note that the ?k? in -r 22050k may be in error.

Unfortunately the amplitude on the modulation was not enough to produce a reasonable strength signal.

The command to get multimon decode a DTMF audio file was 

sox -t wav audio.wav -esigned-integer -b16 -r 22050 -t raw | ./build/multimon-ng -a DTMF -

Note that the final dash may not be right and that it might be followed by ?multimon-ng? .
