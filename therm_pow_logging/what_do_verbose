these are why we do the things to be done to make I2C work

in a file called /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf
use the command
sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf

and edit it so that the line

blacklist i2c-bcm2708

reads

#blacklist i2c-bcm2708
// This is to set the module blacklist off so that the i2c systems can run and use the i2c gpio pins

then add i2c-dev to the /etc/modules
// this is so i2c module loads automatically on boot

install the packages using sudo apt-get install
i2c-tools
python-smbus
// installing these packages allows python to use the smbus functions, skipping most of the legwork

use the command
sudo adduser pi i2c
// gives the user access to the i2c subsystems so that the i2c-tools will work

use sudo reboot or sudo modprobe i2c-dev 
// either loads the i2c-dev module to be used by i2c-tools

to see the i2c devices connected, use
i2cdetect -y 1
// you need this to find out what address to use in the program


the power sensor is probably at address 4c, but if you don't know which one it is, use
powerlog.py
changing the address to each address to try and figure out which device is the correct one
