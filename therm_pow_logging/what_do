these things are to be done to make I2C work

in a file called /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf
use the command
sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf

and edit it so that the line

blacklist i2c-bcm2708

reads

#blacklist i2c-bcm2708

then add i2c-dev to the /etc/modules

install the packages using sudo apt-get install
i2c-tools
python-smbus

use the command
sudo adduser pi i2c

use sudo reboot or sudo modprobe i2c-dev 

to see the i2c devices connected, use
i2cdetect -y 1

the power sensor is probably at address 4c, but if you don't know which one it is, use
powerlog.py
changing the address to each address to try and figure out which device is the correct one
